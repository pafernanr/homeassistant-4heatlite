# Sensors & Entities

## Sensor Entities

| Entity | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| State | Stove operating state (OFF, Check Up, Ignition, Stabilization, Run, Modulation, Extinguishing, etc.) | TCP poll (0310 byte 5) |
| Error | Active error description (None, Failed Ignition, Exhaust over Temperature, etc.) | TCP poll (0310 byte 1) |
| Exhaust Temperature | Exhaust gas temperature in °C | TCP poll (0310 byte 4) |
| Room Temperature | Room temperature in °C (0.1° precision) | TCP poll (0310 bytes 10-11) |
| Target Temperature | Configured target room temperature in °C | TCP poll (12/005a register) |
| Power Level | Current power level setting (1-7) | TCP poll (0e/016c register) |

## Binary Sensor Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Running | ON when stove is in any active state (ignition, run, modulation, stabilization) |
| Error Active | ON when an error code is present |

## Climate Entity

A climate entity is always created for display (current/target temperature, stove state). Write commands (temperature, ON/OFF, power) require the [cloud API proxy](PROXY_MODES.md) — without it, changes are logged but not sent.

When the proxy is enabled:
- **HVAC modes**: OFF / HEAT (sends ON/OFF command to the module)
- **Target temperature**: 10-40°C, 0.1°C step
- **Preset modes**: Power 1-7
- **HVAC action**: OFF, Preheating (ignition), Heating (run/modulation), Idle (extinguishing/standby)

All write commands are queued and delivered to the stove via the proxy within ~60 seconds (module polling interval).

## Register Sensors (from store push)

Additional sensors parsed from the module's `POST /api/devices/store` Values array. These update every ~3 minutes when the proxy is active (cloud_keepalive or local_only mode). In direct mode, these sensors are not populated.

| Entity | Data key | Register | Source (filemap) | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Remote Room Temperature | `remote_room_temp` | 12/ffe0 | Temp ambiente remota | Shows unavailable when 0 (no probe) |
| Remote Room Temperature 2 | `remote_room_temp_2` | 12/ffe8 | Temp ambiente remota 2 | Shows unavailable when 0 (no probe) |
| Airflow | `airflow` | 12/ffed | Flusso aria | Raw value (unit TBD) |
| Heating Fan Power | `heating_fan_power` | 0e/023f | Potencia calefacción | |
| Ducted Fan 1 | `ducted_fan_1` | 0e/0266 | Potencia canalizada 1 | Disabled by default |
| Ducted Fan 2 | `ducted_fan_2` | 0e/027e | Potencia canalizada 2 | Disabled by default |
| Cleaning Counter | `cleaning_counter` | 12/ffde | CLEANING 4WEB | Diagnostic |
| Service Counter | `service_counter` | 12/ffdf | SERVICE 4WEB | Diagnostic, disabled by default |

Registers 12/ffff (exhaust temp) and 12/fff7 (room temp) are also parsed but not exposed as entities — they duplicate data already available from the 0310 sensor block via TCP polling.

## Diagnostic Sensors

Diagnostic sensors for unmapped response bytes are available but disabled by default. Enable them from the entity settings to help identify additional data fields while the stove is running.

## How Sensors Are Updated

The integration uses two data sources:

1. **TCP polling** (primary): Direct queries to the module over TCP:80 using the 2WC protocol. Polls every 30 seconds in local mode, every 120 seconds when the proxy is active.

2. **Proxy push** (real-time): When the proxy is active, the module pushes sensor data via `POST /api/devices/store` every time values change (typically within seconds of a change) and periodically as a keepalive. This data is injected directly into the coordinator, updating all entities immediately without waiting for the next TCP poll.

## 2WC Protocol

The 4HEAT Lite module exposes a TCP server on port 80. The integration sends JSON-encoded 2WC commands to read sensor registers from the stove's Tiemme controller board via the module's RS485 bus.

```
Query:    ["2WC","1","0310"]
Response: ["2WC","1","<38 hex chars>"]
```

The 19-byte response contains the stove state, error code, exhaust temperature, room temperature, and other registers.

### Register Map (0310 response)

| 6-9 | Unknown | - | |
| 10-11 | Room temp | 0.1°C | 2-byte big-endian |

### Write Command Format

Write commands use function code `05` followed by the register address and data:

```
["2WC","1","05<register><data>"]
```

Example — set target temperature to 28.8°C:
```
["2WC","1","0512005a0120006401900001000100"]
```

- `05` — write function
- `12005a` — register group 12, address 005a (target temperature)
- `0120` — 28.8°C (0x120 = 288, in 0.1°C units)
- `0064` — min 10.0°C
- `0190` — max 40.0°C
- `0001000100` — trailing register data
